        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oatmeal is one of my favorite breakfast dishes. However, when not made correctly, it can turn away even the heartiest of eaters. Below is my way of making this classic, which yields oatmeal with a very creamy texture. Enjoy! </p>

    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Oatmeal (instant or old fashion will do)</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cup of whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 stick of salted butter, <strong>not margarine</strong></li>
        <li>Preferred sweetener</li>
        <li>Any other ingredients you would like. Make it your own!</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a boiler add your milk and set to med-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add your oats while the milk is still <strong>cold</strong>.</li>
        <li>Stir frequently, personally I do not stop until finished but that may not be possible for some.  </li>
        <li>Add the butter when you notice it starting to boil and reduce heat to low and allow to thicken.</li>
        <li>Once it thickens you can now sweeten to taste and add any other toppings or ingredients you wish.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>A Few Extras I Enjoy</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Cinnamon, can't beat this classic.</li>
        <li>Maple syrup and brown sugar, another classic.</li>
        <li>Banana and peanut butter, a favorite of the king himself!</li>
    </ul>
